        is a modern twist on the pub classic, with automated scoring and
        real-time feedback. An OpenCV (Python) pipeline localises pucks from a
        single camera, whilst an Electron and Three.js UI renders responsive 3D
        visuals and supports multiple game modes.

            OpenCV (Python) segments by colour, extracts puck contours, and
            emits their centre points each frame. A lightweight game handler
            consumes those points, maintains per-team alive/dead lists, and
            assigns contours to puck objects via nearest-neighbour matching from
            each puckâ€™s last known position. On every tick, the handler streams
            updates to the Electron UI and raises events for wrong turns, bad
            throws, and end-of-round.

            Electron ingests the Python/OpenCV JSON stream, validates and
            normalises events, and updates a UI store. It also manages app state
            and sessions (e.g., hour-long sessions with multiple rounds) and
            exposes features like team selection, camera snapshots (for
            photos/calibration), and remote recalibration. Three.js handles the
            rendering loop, reconciling the 3D scene graph each frame and
            interpolating between CV ticks for smooth animation.

    <li>
      Built real-time 3D visuals driven by a typed event stream; deterministic

    <li>
      Architected Three.js layer (scene graph, cameras, materials), reconciled
      with app state; event-driven render loop to avoid unnecessary frames.
    </li>
    <li>
      Integrated the Python/OpenCV feed into the Electron UI with a lightweight
      event consumer + router.
    </li>
    <li>
      Implemented a pluggable rules engine to support multiple modes
      (TowerStack, Field Raid, Planet Odyssey).
    </li>
    <li>
      Improved performance and stability with telemetry, a debug overlay, and
      remote recalibration.

    <li>
      Maintained ~60&nbsp;FPS with &lt;50&nbsp;ms capture-to-UI latency and ~90%
